# Probability search

Probability search is a self-optimizing linear search implementation which moves queried element towards the beginning of the collection every time it is found.

Apart from sorting the searched collection, probability search behaves the same as [linear search](../linear_search).

**Comparisons:** O(n)

## Use cases

- Some elements are searched for more often than others.

## Requirements

- Searched data can be mutated.
