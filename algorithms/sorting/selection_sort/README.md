# [Selection sort​](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)

**Type:** Selection sort (Comparison sort)

## Performance

| Operation   | Worst  | Average |  Best  |
| :---------- | :----: | :-----: | :----: |
| Comparisons | O(n^2) | Θ(n^2)  | Ω(n^2) |

**Space complexity:** O(1)

## Use cases

- Quick and simple code implementation is needed

**Standard language sort function (if one exists) should be used instead of this algorithm as it's very slow.**
