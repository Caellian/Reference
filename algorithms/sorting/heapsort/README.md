# [Heapsort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort)

**Type:** Selection sort (Comparison sort)

## Performance

| Operation   |   Worst    |  Average   |    Best    |
| :---------- | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: |
| Comparisons | O(n log n) | Θ(n log n) | Ω(n log n) |

**Size complexity:** O(1)

## Use cases

- Stable sort isn't needed
- Worst case performance is more important than average case performance.
- Inputs of very large but not specific size
