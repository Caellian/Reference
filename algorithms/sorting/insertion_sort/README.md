# [Insertion sort​](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)

**Type:** Insertion sort (Comparison sort)

## Performance

| Operation   | Worst  | Average | Best |
| :---------- | :----: | :-----: | :--: |
| Comparisons | O(n^2) | Θ(n^2)  | Ω(n) |
| Swaps       | O(n^2) | Θ(n^2)  | Ω(1) |

**Space complexity:** O(n) total, O(1) auxiliary

## Use cases

- Quick and simple code implementation is needed
- Sorting of small data sets
- Stable sort is needed

_This algorithm is more efficient in practice than other simple quadratic sorting algorithms such as bubble sort or selection sort._
